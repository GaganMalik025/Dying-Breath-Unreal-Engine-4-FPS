# Dying-Breath-Unreal-Engine-4-FPS
Dying Breath is a First Person Shooter game made on Unreal Engine 4.

In Dying Breath, you take control of a "Player" in a "prototype game". You are assisted by an in-game AI. In the game itself, the player is totally aware that he is in a video game and thus, must defeat the minions and then the final boss. But not everything is as it seems. The game's story breaks the 'fourth wall', communicating directly with the plyaer currently playing the game.

The game's story is by no means its highlight as the game's main purpose is to showcase various gameplay features that I am able to implement.

1. Wall Running.
2. Stealth Kills.
3. 2 types of Enemy AIs
4. A Rifle and a Pistol mechanism. A short surprise (third mechanism) in the final level.

The game is very short and is solely meant to showcase the gameplay features implemented.
